		<h2>Game log</h2>

			<p>Instead of messaging system</p>

		<h2>Starting Map</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Randomize loyalty. 5 loyal systems to Rebels. 3 to Imperials, with 2 subjugated planets. Imperials start with Coruscant, Rebels start with Yavin IV.</li>
				<li>Randomize buildings and resources. Each side starts with at least 1 construction yard, 1 training facility, and 1 orbital shipyard.</li>
				<li>Max three of any building type on a planet at start.</li>
				<li>Mask Outer Rim planets</li>
				<li>Start with same group of characters +2 random, or +4 random</li>
				<li>Add intermittent Star Wars and other fun quotes for flavor.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Villages</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>If Rebel loyalty > 65, then planet supports Rebels. If Ministry loyalty > 65, then planet supports Ministry. If niether, planet is neutral.</li>
				<li>If you have troops on the planet and you lose loyalty, calculate uprising and garrison.</li>
				<li>If you do not have troops on the planet and you lose loyalty, planet joins enemy.</li>
				<li>If you lose troops on disloyal planet, calculate uprising and smuggler losses (and enemy information gained).</li>
				<li>Calculate ship blockade/battle/bombardment (listed below)</li>
				<li>Production/Resources/Building availability</li>
				<li>Masked or unmasked to each side</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Successful Diplomacy missions (single village, positive, 100%)
				<li>Successful Incite Uprising missions (single village, positive, 100%)
				<li>Successful Subdue Uprising missions (single village, positive, 100%)
				<li>Invading a village (single village, negative)
				<li>Bombarding and destroying non-military structures on a village (whole region, negative, 100%)
				<li>Destroying enemy ground troops through village bombardment without hitting non-military structures (whole region, positive)
				<li>Destroying enemy capital ship (whole region, positive)
				<li>Fire Ballista destroying a village (the whole map, negative, 100% [may not affect Outer Rim planets])
			</ul>

			<p>And finally, when a system changes sides without being invaded it affects the whole sector. If the planet switches from one side to another or from neutral to one side the effect is positive for whomever it joined. If the planet switches from one side to neutral, the effect is negative for whoever it left.</p>

			<p>Uprisings: If the loyalty of one of your planets is not strongly in your favor you will need a garrison on it to keep it in line.  The garrison requirement can range from 1 - 6 depending on how loyal the planet is to you. If you let the garrison requirement exceed the number of garrison troops on the planet, then the planet will go into an uprising. This is just bad news all around for you. First all production on the planet ceases. Secondly any personnel or troops you have on the planet are at risk. Personnel can be injured by simulated riots on the planet, and even troops on the surface will spontaneously be destroyed if you let the uprising fester long enough. This is extremely dangerous because the game will NOT inform you that the troop regiment was destroyed; they'll just simply disappear. While a planet going into an uprising does not affect other planet's loyalties, if you wait long enough and let all of your ground troops be destroyed your planet will switch alignment, which an be devastating to your sector-wide support. The best way to quell an uprising on one of your planets is a swift response. Gather as many Special Forces and characters as possible and send a single massive Subdue Uprising mission to the planet, and get as many garrison troops as you can spare onto the planet. The defenses menu for the planet may indicate that the planet has a garrison requirement from somewhere from 7-12, or some requirement above the normal high of 6. Even if you meet this, it will NOT end the uprising right then and there, but it's a start. Eventually with enough garrison troops and a subdue uprising mission the planet will change it's tune and come around to your side. But it's important that you respond swiftly to an uprising, as a minor annoyance can turn into a sector- wide crisis.</p>

			<p>Colonization: A great way to expand your resource base and create new production facilities is to move out into the Outer Rim Territories (the sectors on the outside of the galaxy whose planets look initially like stars on the galaxy map. You won't find out anything about these planets until you send a ship to check them out). Unfortunately this takes an agonizing long time before it bears any real fruit, so it's a good idea to start early. The systems in the Outer Rim will either be inhabited or uninhabited. Uninhabited systems have no loyalty bar, because technically there's no one there to have loyalty for either side. To bring an uninhabited planet under your control simply orbit a troop carrying ship around it and click and drag the regiment onto the planet. You cannot invade the planet, just move the regiment to take it. However technically the planet still doesn't have a population. If you remove the troop regiment the planet will go back to being uninhabited, and sector wide support for you will fall, because technically you "lost" a planet. To fully colonize the planet you have to place a building on the system. It doesn't matter what building it is, once the planet has at least one it gains a population and a loyalty bar. You can now remove all the troop regiments from the planet and it will remain under your control. It will start completely loyal to you, but remember that it can still be influenced by the enemy so don't assume it will remain loyal to you for all time. The inhabited systems on the Outer Rim tend to have very fewer energy and mineral resources while the uninhabited ones usually have many of each. Thus, it's a lot easier and cheaper to colonize an uninhabited planet than to take the time to send a diplomat all the way out there or to conquer the planet and keep a garrison there.</p>

					<li>Decrease initial chance of failure</li>
					<li>Increase opponent's initial chance of failure</li>
					<li>Confuse Ministry's searches for stronghold</li>

					<li>Stroke of genius engineering: Build massive (SSD) units that are otherwise not in the production facility</li>
					<li>Improved diplomacy: If Fire Ballista in region, your diplomacy missions in the region are more likely to succeed, and more effective</li>
					<li>Cause village to declare neutrality</li>
					<li>Interrogation missions against captured leaders</li>
					<li>Recon missions</li>
					<li>Anti-espionage missions?</li>
					<li>Turn captured character to your side</li>

				</ul>

		<h2>Facilities</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Multiple facilities decreases the time to production</li>
				<li>How to use resources and raw materials</li>
				<li>Mines and refineries?</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Characters</h2>
			<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J3FpGaFfmQ92Vs-X9DXK8QpZCWVmRGWbLZR7Y6yY5ik/edit#gid=208374039">See "Characters" tab on Google Drive spreadsheet</a></p>
			<p>Consider adding a base location to each character that can be changed, where the character will go automatically if on a failed mission (also consider whether or not to just send them to the closest friendly planet (this is probably the best idea))</p>

		<h2>Special Forces</h2>

		<h2>Troops</h2>

		<h2>Ships</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Add individual stats like characters</li>
				<li>Add a way for them to battle and see individual ship damage and assign targets, probably in a modal, maybe in an expanded hidden area, maybe in its own dedicated battle area like the other panes (personnel, planet)</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Distances</h2>
			<p>Currently not started, but I envision a spreadsheet with each planet as a row and each planet as a column with the travel times as data cells.</p>

		<h2>Cheat Codes</h2>

		<p>For testing. Then we remove them and leave the prompt that replies back if people put in cool Star Wars races or something.</p>
